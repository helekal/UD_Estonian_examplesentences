## Corpus of syntactically annotated example sentences divided into game levels
Corpus is designed especially for games teaching parts of the sentence where example sentences are needed. Corpus contains of 13 files in CoNLL-U-format. Filenames describe for what level the sentences in every file are meant for (eg level_1.conllu consists of sentences for level 1). Every game level has more than 200 sentences.

Every sentence has it's own ID (# sent_id). In every sentence there is at least one Lvl-tag (eg Lvl=1). Words with such tags should be asked in a game. For example, if Lvl="level_number" is tagged to a word with syntactic relation "nsubj", it should be asked in a game (eg a player is either asked to find a subject or give a correct syntactic function of the word shown).
